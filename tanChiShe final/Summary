The final version of y snake game.
I finished this game in spring of 2017, it took me about one week. I create all elements for the game and adjusted them make it work well.
The snake could moved by player's control and when it hits the wall or eats itself, the game is over. Eat egg could gain scores, there is 
unlimit for the game, the play could earn as high as they can.
